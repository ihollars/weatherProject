# weatherProject
This contains the weather prediction project that I worked on in MTH2895

Accurate weather forecasts are often taken for granted, but they help guide business decisions and help people plan every day.
One thing that sparked my interest in this topic was my morning running routine in Nashville. 
Having an estimate of the temperature and the precipitation was a big help on deciding how to dress. 
I was curious to see how difficult making weather predictions would be just by using the previous few days of weather 
to make educated predictions via machine learning models.
